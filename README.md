# UniversityApplicationWebApp
 
# About this repo:
This repo is a group project made by Jungwook Jang, Elisa Hu and Henry Roh.
It contains the website source code including Javascript, html, css, sql, and php files. The project intends to provide a University Application System the basic database and given a user interface for the students(including Highschool students and transfer studnt) and University recruiter.

# The source code:
The source code for this project can be found in the folder: src. All the Javascript, html, php, and sql files directly available are the code for the content of the website. 

We used vanilla html, css, php and a bit of bootstrap for the webapp. 

# Detailed information:
The domain that we are going to model is the digital university application process. The aspect of the application that we will be modeling will be about high school students (applicants) applying to the university. This includes things like the student account for individual applicants, basic information that one student has (name, address, gender, gpa), and an unique ID for each student, the list of universities they have applied to.

There will be two different classes of users of the system: the applicants (high school students) and the university recruiters (represent each university, one university only has one recruiter). The applicants will be able to access their own accounts and apply to different universities through the website, see the status of the applications (viewed, declined or offered). Choose to accept it or not (if the applicants accept one offer, he cannot apply to other universities). University recruiters can see all the applicant's information applied to his/her university (viewed). Only university recruiters can change the application statutes for individual applicants. This database system provides a clear view for students applications and recruiters for making decisions and applications. This project is done using MYSQL, PHP, HTML. More specifically the current expected stack is MYSQL .
